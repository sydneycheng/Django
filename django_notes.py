# HTML info
# get request - database sends data to the application server (tanscribes into code)
# --> shows on the webpage

# post request - sends info to the database

# django is an all encompasing framework

# learning log
# models.py --> where we write code to create differnt "tables" (aka: objects) in our database


# DJANGO


## Starting our project
## the name of our project is learning_log --> it's important that we use a " ."

# django-admin startproject learning_log .
# this creates the "learning_log" folder as well as "manage.py"
# "manage.py" includes everything that makes our code run


## Create our database --> use MIGRATE command

# must use MIGRATE command everytime changes are made to our code
# python3 manage.py migrate
# this creates a database "db.sqlite3"
# sqlite is a database used for smaller development purposes
# on our local server


## We'll test our server by running it

# python3 manage.py runserver
# this downloads a default jango page (via a link)
# is a server on your local machine (rocket screen)
# the server continues running
# to Stop the server "ctrl + C"  --> if you try and refresh server, it will give an error


## Debugger: Instead of running this "runserver" command each time, use debugger

# click on "manage.py"
# go to debugger
# click "create a launch.json file"
# press Play button --> server should be up and running again

## Project has been completed...


## Create a new web APP (journal entry)

# python3 manage.py startapp MainApp
# this creates a folder "MainApp" which includes several files, incl...
# admin.py, models.py, tests.py, views.py, etc.
# this has created a new app "MainApp"

## Need to tell our project that we've created a new app so it's included in the installed app

# under "learning_log" go to settings.py and find INSTALLED APPS
# add "MainApp" to installed apps


## Add our first model in "models.py" under "MainApp"

# create class Topic
# create str method
# table has been created

## When we make changes to our database, we must follow 2 STEPS


## STEP 1: Run the code on the database (makemigrations)
# python3 manage.py makemigrations
# this looks at "models.py" to see the changes you just made

## STEP 2:
# python3 manage.py migrate
# tells us that the changes to the structure of our database have been made


## on the website, django allows us to acces the admin side via a Super User

# create username: admin and unique password
# fire up server
# type /admin on webpage to access admin portal on your webpage


## STEP 3: Register models under "admin.py"

# allows us to access model on admin side


## Add another model called "Entry" in "models.py"

# we want to create a relationship btwn
# we want a Topic to have multiple Entries
# create Entry class
# this acts as a Foreign Key relationship
